## 🪄 About Me

I'm a 4th-semester Computer Science student at the University of Zielona Góra, focused on UX/UI and mobile app development.  
I believe in **minimalism** and draw inspiration from **Material Design** principles—design should be both beautiful and make life easier for the user.

- 🎨 I value clarity, aesthetics, and smart solutions.
- 📱 Learning to create mobile applications that are intuitive and genuinely helpful.
- 🧩 Always exploring new tools and trends in UX/UI to improve my skills.
- 🤝 Actively seeking an internship where I can learn under the guidance of experienced specialists and grow through real-world projects.
